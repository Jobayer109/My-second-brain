### 1. **What is Git?**
   - **Answer**: Git is a distributed version control system that helps developers track changes in their code, collaborate with others, and maintain different versions of their projects.

### 2. **What is GitHub?**
   - **Answer**: GitHub is a web-based platform that uses Git for version control. It allows developers to host repositories, collaborate, and manage projects online.

### 3. **What is a repository in Git?**
   - **Answer**: A repository (repo) is a storage space where your project and its history (versions, commits) are stored. It can be local (on your machine) or remote (on GitHub).

### 4. **What is the difference between Git and GitHub?**
   - **Answer**: Git is a version control tool for tracking changes in code, while GitHub is a platform that hosts Git repositories and provides additional collaboration tools like pull requests, issues, and web hosting.

### 5. **How do you clone a repository?**
   - **Answer**: Use the command:
     ```bash
     git clone <repository-url>
     ```
     This creates a copy of a remote repository on your local machine.

### 6. **What is a commit in Git?**
   - **Answer**: A commit is a snapshot of changes made in your repository. It acts as a save point in your project, capturing a specific state of the code.

### 7. **How do you create a new branch in Git?**
   - **Answer**: You can create a new branch using the command:
     ```bash
     git branch <branch-name>
     ```
     Or, you can create and switch to it with:
     ```bash
     git checkout -b <branch-name>
     ```

### 8. **What is the difference between `git fetch` and `git pull`?**
   - **Answer**: 
     - `git fetch` downloads changes from the remote repository but doesnâ€™t merge them into your working code.
     - `git pull` fetches the changes and merges them directly into your local branch.

### 9. **How do you resolve merge conflicts in Git?**
   - **Answer**: Git will indicate files with conflicts. You need to open those files, manually edit the conflicting parts, and then stage and commit the resolved files:
     ```bash
     git add <resolved-file>
     git commit
     ```

### 10. **What is a pull request (PR) on GitHub?**
   - **Answer**: A pull request is a way to propose changes to a repository. You create a PR to let others review and discuss your code before merging it into the main branch.

These answers should help provide clear and concise responses to common Git and GitHub interview questions.
