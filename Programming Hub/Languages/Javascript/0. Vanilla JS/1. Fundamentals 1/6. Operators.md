## Assignment Operators
Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables.

  ```javascript
  let x = 10;
  ```

- **Addition assignment (`+=`)**
  ```javascript
  let x = 10;
  x += 5;  // x = 15
  ```

- **Subtraction assignment (`-=`)**
  ```javascript
  let x = 10;
  x -= 5;  // x = 5
  ```

- **Multiplication assignment (`*=`)**
  ```javascript
  let x = 10;
  x *= 5;  // x = 50
  ```

- **Division assignment (`/=`)**
  ```javascript
  let x = 10;
  x /= 5;  // x = 2
  ```

- **Modulus assignment (`%=`)**
  ```javascript
  let x = 10;
  x %= 5;  // x = 0
  ```

- **Exponentiation assignment (`**=`)**
  ```javascript
  let x = 10;
  x **= 2;  // x = 100
  ```

## Comparison Operators
Comparison operators are used to compare two values.

- **Equal (`==`)**
  ```javascript
  let x = 5;
  let y = "5";
  x == y;  // true
  ```

- **Strict equal (`===`)**
  ```javascript
  let x = 5;
  let y = "5";
  x === y;  // false
  ```

- **Not equal (`!=`)**
  ```javascript
  let x = 5;
  let y = "5";
  x != y;  // false
  ```

- **Strict not equal (`!==`)**
  ```javascript
  let x = 5;
  let y = "5";
  x !== y;  // true
  ```

- **Greater than (`>`)**
  ```javascript
  let x = 5;
  let y = 2;
  x > y;  // true
  ```

- **Less than (`<`)**
  ```javascript
  let x = 5;
  let y = 2;
  x < y;  // false
  ```

- **Greater than or equal (`>=`)**
  ```javascript
  let x = 5;
  let y = 2;
  x >= y;  // true
  ```

- **Less than or equal (`<=`)**
  ```javascript
  let x = 5;
  let y = 5;
  x <= y;  // true
  ```

## String Comparison:

###### Example: 1
``` javascript
let text1 = "9";
let text2 = "30";
let result = text1 < text2;
```
ব্যাখ্যা: 
- The first character of text1 is '9', and the first character of text2 is '3'.
- The Unicode code point for '9' is greater than the Unicode code point for '3'.
- Since the first character of text1 is greater than the first character of text2, the comparison text1 < text2 evaluates to false.
So, in this specific case, result will be false because '9' is not less than '30' in terms of lexicographical order.


###### Example: 2
```javascript
let text1 = "A";
let text2 = "C";
let result = text1 < text2;
```
ব্যাখ্যা:
- Here's how the comparison happens step by step:
- The first characters of each string are compared. In this case, it's 'A' from text1 and 'C' from text2.
- The Unicode value of 'A' is 65, and the Unicode value of 'C' is 67.
- Since 65 is less than 67, the comparison evaluates to true.
- The result variable is assigned the value true.
So, in this specific example, text1 is indeed lexicographically less than text2, resulting in the result being true

###### Example: 3
```javascript
let text1 = "ABD";
let text2 = "CKA";
let result = text1 < text2;  // true
```
 
 `Note:` 
  Compare the first characters of text1 and text2:
- First character of text1 is 'A'. First character of text2 is 'C'.

## Logical Operators
Logical operators are used to determine the logic between variables or values.

- **Logical AND (`&&`)**
  ```javascript
  let x = true;
  let y = false;
  x && y;  // false
  ```

- **Logical OR (`||`)**
  ```javascript
  let x = true;
  let y = false;
  x || y;  // true
  ```

- **Logical NOT (`!`)**
  ```javascript
  let x = true;
  !x;  // false
  ```

---
## Bitwise Operators
Bitwise operators are used to perform bitwise operations on binary numbers.

- **AND (`&`)**
  ```javascript
  let x = 5;   // 0101
  let y = 1;   // 0001
  let z = x & y;  // 0001
  ```

- **OR (`|`)**
  ```javascript
  let x = 5;   // 0101
  let y = 1;   // 0001
  let z = x | y;  // 0101
  ```

- **NOT (`~`)**
  ```javascript
  let x = 5;   // 0101
  let z = ~x;  // 1010 (inverts each bit)
  ```

- **XOR (`^`)**
  ```javascript
  let x = 5;   // 0101
  let y = 1;   // 0001
  let z = x ^ y;  // 0100
  ```

- **Left shift (`<<`)**
  ```javascript
  let x = 5;   // 0101
  let z = x << 1;  // 1010
  ```

- **Right shift (`>>`)**
  ```javascript
  let x = 5;   // 0101
  let z = x >> 1;  // 0010
  ```

- **Unsigned right shift (`>>>`)**
  ```javascript
  let x = -5;
  let z = x >>> 1;  // shift right and fill with zeros
  ```
