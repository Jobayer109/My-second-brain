### JavaScript Runtime

A JavaScript runtime is **an environment** that provides the necessary components to execute JavaScript code. It typically includes:

1. **JavaScript Engine**: The core component that interprets and executes JavaScript code (e.g., Google's V8 engine used in Node.js and Chrome).
2. **Runtime APIs**: Additional libraries and APIs that provide functionalities such as file system access, network requests, and timers, which are not available in the basic JavaScript engine.
3. **Event Loop**: A mechanism that continuously checks the call stack to see if itâ€™s empty. If the stack is empty, it processes the next message in the callback queue.
4. **Callback Queue**: A queue that holds callbacks (functions to be executed) that are ready to be processed after asynchronous operations complete. The event loop pulls these callbacks into the call stack for execution when the stack is empty.
