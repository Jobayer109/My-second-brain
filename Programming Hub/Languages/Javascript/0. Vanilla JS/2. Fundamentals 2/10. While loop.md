### General Syntax
```javascript
while (condition) {
    // Code to be executed as long as the condition is true
}
```

###### components
1. **Condition**
2. **Code Block**

###### Basic While Loop
```javascript
let i = 0;
while (i < 5) {
    console.log(i);
    i++;
}
```
This loop will print numbers from 0 to 4.

---

### Infinite Loop
Be careful with `while` loops to ensure the condition will eventually become false. Otherwise, it will create an infinite loop.

###### Example of Infinite Loop
```javascript
while (true) {
    console.log("This will run forever");
}
```
This loop will run indefinitely because the condition always evaluates to true.

---

### Breaking Out of a While Loop
You can use the `break` statement to exit a `while` loop prematurely.
###### Example
```javascript
let i = 0;
while (i < 10) {
    if (i === 5) {
        break; // Exit the loop when i is 5
    }
    console.log(i);
    i++;
}
```
This loop will print numbers from 0 to 4 and then exit when `i` equals 5.

### Skipping an Iteration
The `continue` statement can be used to skip the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration of the loop.

###### Example
```javascript
let i = 0;
while (i < 5) {
    i++;
    if (i === 3) {
        continue; // Skip the iteration when i is 3
    }
    console.log(i);
}
```
This loop will print numbers 1, 2, 4, and 5, skipping 3.


---
### Do...While Loop
The `do...while` loop is a variant of the `while` loop. It guarantees that the code block will be executed at least once because the condition is evaluated after the code block is executed.

###### Syntax
```javascript
do {
    // Code to be executed
} while (condition);
```

###### Example
```javascript
let i = 0;
do {
    console.log(i);
    i++;
} while (i < 5);
```
This loop will print numbers from 0 to 4.

### Common Pitfalls
- **Infinite Loops**: Ensure the loop condition will eventually become false.
- **Off-by-One Errors**: Be careful with loop conditions to ensure the correct number of iterations.
- **Mutating Loop Variable**: Ensure the loop variable is correctly updated within the loop to prevent infinite loops.
